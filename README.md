# TDD-Readme
This is a base document for creating TDD

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to summarize technical requirements during the business process mapping phase of the implementation.
This document represents information gathered in meetings held with the internal teams and customer to map an efficient flow in the NetSuite application.  Once complete, this document will serve as a blueprint to develop and configure the application, NetSuite version 2022.2.
A series of meetings, focusing on the key areas of the delivery, were used as a starting point for this exercise. This document is inclusive of all custom script requirements provided by the Customer.

## Business Requirement Abstract
